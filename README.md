First of, the actual helmet design isn't mine. I got the STL files from this madlad on thingiverse (definitely donate him a couple bucks if you can) then altered the dimensions for a nice snug fit.
My head isn't yours, you'll have to break out the calipers and tape measure if you care as much as I did.
